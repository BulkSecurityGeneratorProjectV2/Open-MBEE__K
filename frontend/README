- The classes need to be built using the ./build.sh command. This
  issues a single javac command to compile all Model*.java classes.  

- After compiling, you can run the parser by issuing the ./prase.sh
  command as follows: 
  ./parse.sh <path to model file> <extra arguments to ANTLR4 grun system>
  Example: ./parse.sh ../examples/ex1/statemachine -gui
